				<p>This is a Star Wars opening crawl generator, complete with <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/glup-shitto">Glup Shittos</a>, 
					nostalgia farming, and random Dune references! The results are often silly, sometimes oddly compelling, and always Star Wars-y.
					This experiment builds off of Adam Smith's Glitch game, <a href="https://glitch.com/~bad-quests">bad-quests</a>.

			<!-- TECH SECTION -->
			<div class="minor-section"  style="font-family: Calibri; color: #fff; margin: 1em; background:  #ff7070; border: none">
				<h2 style="font-weight: 900">Technical</h2>
				<p>For the text of the main body, this generator
					uses a template based on <i>A New Hope</i>'s <a href="https://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-opening-crawl">opening crawl</a>,
					and for the titles, it randomly chooses a template from an array of templates modeled after the nine films' titles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The generator uses a <tt>replacer()</tt> function to randomly fill dynamic slots with words from a <tt>filler()</tt> bank. For static slots (words that will
					be repeated later in the template, denoted by a pipe symbol in the template), the generator uses a <tt>setter()</tt> function, which works similarly to 
					<tt>replacer()</tt> with an additional map check. If the static slot has not yet been defined, then the slot ID is added to the map, along with a random
					index. Then, if the generator finds an already-defined but unfilled static slot, then it can refer to the slot ID in the map and fill that slot with the
					same value. This was a necessary iteration to Smith's implementation for the generator to maintain things like faction names and Glup Shitto pronouns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Title generation required some additional steps, as well. The title is initially generated using the same functions as the main body. Next, the generator 
					checks that there are more than two words in the title. I added this check to align with all of the Star Wars film titles' word counts. Although it seems like
					a minor attribute, I found that the two-word titles just didn't feel Star Wars-y -- so to fix this, the generator prepends short titles with "THE." There is also 
					a coinflip check to prepend a "THE" if the generator has not already done so. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to get the generated text to scroll, <tt>sketch.js</tt>'s <tt>draw()</tt> function uses several p5.js functions to tilt, translate, and raise the text, 
					resulting in a crawl animation that is very similar to what you'll see at the beginning of a Star Wars movie. I found the code for this online -- see the original here:
					<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Codefish/sketches/fABwyG9Jz">Star Wars opening crawl</a> by CodeFish via p5js.org!

				<h2 style="font-weight: 900">Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This was my first time working with grammars, and for such a simple concept I found myself getting really excited about the potency of grammars-based
					generation. I'm happy with the variety of outputs, and I think that, due to the OOP-ness of the genrator itself, it will be easy to expand the generator
					to further increase the variety of outputs. I also always enjoy working with p5.js -- there always seems to be an in-house function for whatever I'm trying to
					do, and the online community provides a lot of additional support. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing that irks me about the generator is that it can sometimes feel a bit <i>too</i> random. I like the silliness (Star Wars is often 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsjwVu_ihKU">silly</a>), but I'd prefer it if things like the galaxy's <tt>starting state</tt> (i.e. civil war) 
					and the <tt>end state</tt> (i.e. peace) felt more related. Right now, the Galaxy might start off in a "year of boredom" and the Glup Shitto is trying to 
					"restore peace." The next iteration of this project will likely adress this with some kind of mapping, or by defining sub-keys to guide the output a bit
					more precisely. In a similar vein, I'd like for some the static slots to be filled with synonyms (instead of repeating, for example, "plans" throughout, 
					the generator might switch to "blueprints" or "schematics").
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, I'd like to add a star field, film grain, and (generative?) music to get this thing Star Wars-maxxed.
